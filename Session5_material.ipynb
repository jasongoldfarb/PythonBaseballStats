    "# Session 5: Final Project – Fantasy Baseball Team Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the final session! In this project, you’ll draft a fantasy baseball team using real MLB data. You'll calculate statistics to evaluate players, and then you’ll assemble your dream team. However, the name of this game is identify a team that is best at [Small Ball]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_ball_(baseball)').\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to draft players from 2024 on your team not based on the home runs, I know bummer, but using the following three metrics I created that are centered around a players small ball mentality: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **OBP (On-Base Percentage)**: Measures how often a batter reaches base on any play except for a fielder's choice or error. \n",
    "- **SBED (Stolen Base Effectiveness Differential)**: Highlights the efficiency of a player's attemped stolen bases\n",
    "- **ATR (Assist-to-Run Ratio)**: Measures unselfish run-creation\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, use your favorite statistic or create a new metric that may help your team to win the fantasy small ball competition.\n",
