# Summer Program: Statistics, Python, and Baseball
Welcome to the 5-session summer program focused on basic statistics, Python programming, and baseball analytics using the `pybaseball` package.

This program is designed for beginners and baseball fans who are interested in learning how to analyze real-world sports data using Python. By the end of the program, you’ll have had an introduction into some of the essential statistical concepts and Python skills, all while exploring baseball data.

## What to Expect

### Expectation Overview
Each session notebook will include:
- Objectives: what you’ll learn in the session
- Topics Covered: key statistics and Python concepts
- Python Code Examples: to practice and learn coding skills
- Statistics Formulas: basic mathematical foundations
- Activity Questions: exercises with hints to guide your learning
- Helpful Links: for further exploration

Listed below is the format for the course and expectations for engagement:
- Each session will be one hour long.
- Students should expect to spend one to two hours per week on assignments outside of class.
- Answer keys for assignments will be posted one to two days before they are due. An example answer key is already available.
- This approach is subject to adjustment as the course progress and based on students needs and students' interests.
- Please feel free to add questions to our [repos discussion board](https://github.com/jasongoldfarb/PythonBaseballStats/discussions). I will create a new discussion after each meeting. Feel free to also reach out via text or email.
